I have backend!!! (some kind of)

Versions will be only after I make the basic upload & review stuff. This will be v1.0.0 which will be used for all the demos to get money and attention. Then I am going to start using CHANGELOG - next versions will have fully functional backend - i.e. with authetication management and with captcha management.

Now openapi-generator. It takes openapi docs and generates services and models from it for typescript frontend.
